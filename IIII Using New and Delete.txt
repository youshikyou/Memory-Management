Comparing malloc with new
The functions malloc and free are library function and represent the default way of allocating and deallocating memory in C. 
In C++, they are also part of the standard and can be used to allocate blocks of memory on the heap.

With the introduction of classes and object oriented programming in C++ however, memory allocation and deallocation has become more complex: 
When an object is created, its constructor needs to be called to allow for member initialization. Also, on object deletion, 
the destructor is called to free resources and to allow for programmer-defined clean-up tasks. For this reason, C++ introduces 
the operators new / delete, which represent the object-oriented counterpart to memory management with malloc / free.

If we were to create a C++ object with malloc, the constructor and destructor of such an object would not be called. 
Consider the class example4.1.1.cpp. The constructor allocates memory for the private element _number 
(yes, we could have simply used int instead of int*, but that's for educational purposes only), 
and the destructor releases memory again. 
The setter method setNumber finally assigns a value to _number under the assumption that memory has been allocated previously.

In main, we will allocate memory for an instance of MyClass using both malloc/ free and new/delete.

With malloc, the program crashes on calling the method setNumber, as no memory has been allocated for _number 
- because the constructor has not been called. Hence, an EXC_BAD_ACCESS error occurs, 
when trying to access the memory location to which _number is pointing. With _new, the output looks like the following:

    Allocate memory
    Number: 42
    Delete memory

Before we go into further details of new/delete, let us briefly summarize the major differences between malloc/free and new/delete:

1.Constructors / Destructors Unlike malloc( sizeof(MyClass) ), the call new MyClass() calls the constructor. 
Similarly, delete calls the destructor.

2.Type safety malloc returns a void pointer, which needs to be cast into the appropriate data type it points to. 
This is not type safe, as you can freely vary the pointer type without any warnings or errors from the compiler 
as in the following small example: MyObject *p = (MyObject*)malloc(sizeof(int));
In C++, the call MyObject *p = new MyObject() returns the correct type automatically - it is thus type-safe.

3.Operator Overloading As malloc and free are functions defined in a library, their behavior can not be changed easily. 
The new and delete operators however can be overloaded by a class in order to include optional proprietary behavior.



Creating and Deleting Objects
As with malloc and free, a call to new always has to be followed by a call to delete to ensure that memory is properly deallocated. 
If the programmer forgets to call delete on the object (which happens quite often, even with experienced programmers), 
the object resides in memory until the program terminates at some point in the future causing a memory leak.

Let us revisit a part of the code
    myClass = new MyClass();
    myClass->setNumber(42); // works as expected
    delete myClass;

The call to new has the following consequences:
1.Memory is allocated to hold a new object of type MyClass
2.A new object of type MyClass is constructed within the allocated memory by calling the constructor of MyClass

The call to delete causes the following:
1.The object of type MyClass is destroyed by calling its destructor
2.The memory which the object was placed in is deallocated



Optimizing Performance with placement new
In some cases, it makes sense to separate memory allocation from object construction. 
Consider a case where we need to reconstruct an object several times. If we were to use the standard new/delete construct, 
memory would be allocated and freed unnecessarily as only the content of the memory block changes but not its size. 
By separating allocation from construction, we can get a significant performance increase.

C++ allows us to do this by using a construct called placement new: With placement new, we can pass a preallocated memory 
and construct an object at that memory location. Consider the following code:

    void *memory = malloc(sizeof(MyClass));
    MyClass *object = new (memory) MyClass;
The syntax new (memory) is denoted as placement new. 
The difference to the "conventional" new we have been using so far is that that no memory is allocated. 
The call constructs an object and places it in the assigned memory location. 
There is however, no delete equivalent to placement new, so we have to call the destructor explicitly in this case 
instead of using delete as we would have done with a regular call to new:

    object->~MyClass();
    free(memory); 
Important: Note that this should never be done outside of placement new.



Overloading new and delete
One of the major advantages of new/delete over free/malloc is the possibility of overloading. 
While both malloc and free are function calls and thus can not be changed easily, new and delete are operators 
and can thus be overloaded to integrate customized functionality, if needed.

The syntax for overloading the new operator looks as follows:

    void* operator new(size_t size);

The operator receives a parameter size of type size_t, which specifies the number of bytes of memory to be allocated. 
The return type of the overloaded new is a void pointer, which references the beginning of the block of allocated memory.

The syntax for overloading the delete operator looks as follows:

    void operator delete(void*);

The operator takes a pointer to the object which is to be deleted. 
As opposed to new, the operator delete does not have a return value.

Let us consider the example4.4.2.cpp.
Both the new and the delete operator are overloaded. In new, the size of the class object in bytes is printed to the console. 
Also, a block of memory of that size is allocated on the heap and the pointer to this block is returned. 
In delete, the block of memory is freed again. The console output of this example looks as follows:
    new: Allocating 4 bytes of memory
    Constructor is called
    Destructor is called
    delete: Memory is freed again
As can be seen from the order of text output, memory is instantiated in new before the constructor is called, 
while the order is reversed for the destructor and the call to delete.



Overloading new[] and delete[]
In addition to the new and delete operators we have seen so far, we can use the following code to create an array of objects:
    void* operator new[](size_t size);
    void operator delete[](void*);

Let us consider the example4.4.3.cpp, which has been slightly modified to allocate an array of objects instead of a single one.
In main, we are now creating an array of three objects of MyClass. 
Also, the overloaded new and delete operators have been changed to accept arrays. Let us take a look at the console output:
    new: Allocating 20 bytes of memory
    Constructor is called
    Constructor is called
    Constructor is called
    Destructor is called
    Destructor is called
    Destructor is called
    delete: Memory is freed again

Interestingly, the memory requirement is larger than expected: With new, the block size was 4 bytes, 
which is exactly the space required for a single integer. Thus, with three integers, it should now be 12 bytes instead of 20 bytes. 
The reason for this is the memory allocation overhead that the compiler needs to keep track of the allocated blocks of memory 
- which in itself consumes memory. If we change the above call to e.g. new MyClass[100](), 
we will see that the overhead of 8 bytes does not change:
    new: Allocating 408 bytes of memory
    Constructor is called
    â€¦
    Destructor is called
    delete: Memory is freed again



Typical Memory Management Problems
Overview of memory management problems
One of the primary advantages of C++ is the flexibility and control of resources such as memory it gives to the programmer. 
This advantage is further amplified by a significant increase in the performance of C++ programs compared to other languages 
such as Python or Java.

However, these advantages come at a price as they demand a high level of experience from the programer. 
As Bjarne Stroustrup put it so elegantly:

"C makes it easy to shoot yourself in the foot; C++ makes it harder, but when you do it blows your whole leg off".

In this chapter, we will look at a collection of typical errors in memory management that you need to watch out for.

1.Memory Leaks Memory leaks occur when data is allocated on the heap at runtime, but not properly deallocated. 
A program that forgets to clear a memory block is said to have a memory leak - this may be a serious problem or not, 
depending on the circumstances and on the nature of the program. For a program that runs, computes something, 
and quits immediately, memory leaks are usually not a big concern. Memory leaks are mostly problematic for programs 
that run for a long time and/or use large data structures. In such a case, memory leaks 
can gradually fill the heap until allocation requests can no longer be properly met and the program stops responding or crashes completely. 
We will look at an example further down in this section.

2.Buffer Overruns Buffer overruns occur when memory outside the allocated limits is overwritten and thus corrupted. 
One of the resulting problems is that this effect may not become immediately visible. 
When a problem finally does occur, cause and effect are often hard to discern. 
It is also sometimes possible to inject malicious code into programs in this way, but this shall not be discussed here.

In this example, the allocated stack memory is too small to hold the entire string, which results in a segmentation fault:
    char str[5];
    strcpy(str,"BufferOverrun");
    printf("%s",str);

3.Uninitialized Memory Depending on the C++ compiler, data structures are sometimes initialized (most often to zero) and sometimes not. 
So when allocating memory on the heap without proper initialization, it might sometimes contain garbage that can cause problems.

Generally, a variable will be automatically initialized in these cases:

    it is a class instance where the default constructor initializes all primitive types
    array initializer syntax is used, such as int a[10] = {}
    it is a global or extern variable
    it is defined static
The behavior of the following code is potentially undefined:
    int a;
    int b=a*42;
    printf("%d",b);

4.Incorrect pairing of allocation and deallocation Freeing a block of memory more than once will cause a program to crash. 
This can happen when a block of memory is freed that has never been allocated or has been freed before. 
Such behavior could also occur when improper pairings of allocation and deallocation are used such as using malloc() 
with delete or new with free().

In this first example, the wrong new and delete are paired>
    double *pDbl=new double[5];
    delete pDbl;
in this second example, the pairing is correct but a double deletion is performed:
    char *pChr=new char[5];
    delete[] pChr;
    delete[] pChr;

5.Invalid memory access This error occurs then trying to access a block of heap memory that has not yet or has already been deallocated.

In this example, the heap memory has already been deallocated at the time when strcpy() tries to access it:
    char *pStr=new char[25];
    delete[] pStr;
    strcpy(pStr, "Invalid Access");
